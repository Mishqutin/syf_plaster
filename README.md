## Directory overview

System's more or less complaint with Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 3.0:  
[FHS_3.0](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/index.html)  
  
btw:  
**`system/` - SYSTEM/ IS GONE \*Crab Rave song playing\*.**  
  



#### random heading
**Syntax described below may change in future.**

so you put e.g. dick.py in /bin and inside write:
```
def main(path, args, cData):
    return {"msg": 'daddys long purple throbbing dick'}
```
and yo have yo command then just write `dick` in console and yeah.


**For a good example, go die.**
